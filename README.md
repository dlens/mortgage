# Mortgage Savings Calculator

* [Mortgage Savings Calculator](calculator.html): How much many can you save by paying a bit more on each payment?  A surprising amount!
* [Simpler view of the calculator](calculatorv2.html): This is a simpler view of the calculator.  It is the same calculation though.

# Information
* In [MortgageExamples.ipynb](MortgageExamples.ipynb) we have the mathematical explanations and formula derivations.  Additionally there is some Python code that performs the calculation.
* The code for the [calculator.html](calculator.html) app is organized as follows:
  * [mortgage.js](mortgage.js): javascript calculation code
  * [myexpect.js](myexpect.js): a simple unit testing framework I created for other projects to allow a poor man's version of unit testing that can be run in a browser.
  * [test/browser_test.html](test/browser_test.html): The actual unit tests that can be run in any browser.
  * [calculator.css](calculator.css): The style sheet for the calculator app.
